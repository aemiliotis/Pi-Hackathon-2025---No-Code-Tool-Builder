# Privacy Policy for Pi No-Code Tool Builder

**Last Updated: August 26, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how the Pi No-Code Tool Builder application ("App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our services. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices. This policy is designed to be clear and concise, allowing Pioneers to understand how their information is handled.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve our services to you. The types of information we collect depend on how you interact with our App.

### 1.1 Information You Provide Directly

When you use the Pi No-Code Tool Builder, you may provide us with certain information directly. This includes:

*   **Pi Network User Information:** When you log in to our App using your Pi Network account, we receive your **Pi Network User ID (UID)** and **Pi Network Username**. This information is essential for authenticating your identity, associating tools you create with your account, and displaying your username as the creator of published tools. We do not collect or store your Pi Network password or any other sensitive authentication credentials.

*   **Tool Configuration Data:** When you create, edit, or save tools using our no-code builder, the configuration data for these tools is stored. This includes:
    *   **Tool Name:** The name you assign to your tool.
    *   **Tool Description:** The description you provide for your tool.
    *   **Tool Type:** The category of the tool (e.g., Form Tool, Calculator, Unit Converter, Text Generator, Survey, Quiz, Poll, Event Scheduler, Progress Tracker, Data Validator).
    *   **Fields Configuration:** For tools like forms, surveys, or quizzes, this includes the labels, types (e.g., text input, textarea, number, email), and any specific options (e.g., dropdown choices) you define for the fields within your tool. This data is stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

*   **Input Data for Tool Execution:** When you or other users execute a tool created on our platform, the data entered into that tool (e.g., form submissions, calculator expressions, converter values, survey responses, quiz answers) is processed and, in some cases, stored as part of the tool execution record. This is necessary for the tool to function and for you to review past executions.

*   **Communication Data:** If you contact us for support, feedback, or inquiries, we may collect the content of your communications and any contact information you provide (e.g., your Pi Network Username or other identifiers).

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically

When you access and use the App, we may automatically collect certain information about your device and usage patterns. This information helps us understand how our App is used, improve its functionality, and ensure its stability. This may include:

*   **Usage Data:** Information about how you interact with the App, such as the features you use, the tools you create or execute, the time and date of your activities, and the duration of your sessions. This helps us identify popular features and areas for improvement.

*   **Technical Data:** Information about your device and connection, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, and device identifiers. This data is primarily used for debugging, security, and ensuring compatibility.

*   **Tool Execution Records:** We automatically log each instance of a tool being executed on our platform. These records include the `tool_id`, the `input_data` provided to the tool, the `output_data` generated by the tool, and optionally the `user_uid` if the execution was performed by a logged-in user. This data is crucial for the functionality of the tools and for creators to understand how their tools are being used.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for various purposes, primarily to operate, maintain, and improve the Pi No-Code Tool Builder. Our uses include:

*   **To Provide and Maintain the App:** This includes enabling you to log in, create, save, and manage your no-code tools, and allowing other users to execute published tools.

*   **To Personalize Your Experience:** We use your Pi Network User ID and Username to associate tools with your account and display your creator name on published tools.

*   **To Improve and Develop New Features:** By analyzing usage patterns and tool execution data, we can identify areas for enhancement, fix bugs, and develop new tool types or functionalities that meet user needs.

*   **For Security and Fraud Prevention:** We use technical data and usage patterns to detect and prevent unauthorized access, fraudulent activities, and other security breaches.

*   **For Analytics and Research:** We may use aggregated and anonymized data for internal research and analytical purposes to understand user behavior and market trends. This data does not identify you personally.

*   **To Communicate with You:** If you contact us, we will use your communication data to respond to your inquiries and provide support.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We are committed to minimizing data sharing. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:

*   **With Your Consent:** We may share your information if you give us explicit consent to do so.

*   **Publicly Available Information:** When you publish a tool, its name, description, type, fields configuration, and your Pi Network Username (as the creator) become publicly accessible. Anyone can view and execute your published tools. Input and output data from public tool executions may also be visible to the tool creator.

*   **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency request).

*   **To Enforce Our Terms:** We may share information to enforce our Terms of Service or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the App, our users, or others.

*   **Aggregated or Anonymized Data:** We may share aggregated or anonymized data that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we might share statistics about the most popular tool types or the total number of tool executions.

## 4. Data Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide you with the App services, fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, and comply with our legal obligations. For example, tool configuration data and execution records are retained as long as the tool exists on the platform. If you delete a tool, its associated data will be removed from our active databases within a reasonable timeframe.

## 6. Your Rights

As a user of the Pi No-Code Tool Builder, you have certain rights regarding your information:

*   **Access and Correction:** You have the right to access and update the information associated with your tools. You can typically do this directly within the App interface.

*   **Deletion:** You can delete the tools you have created. Deleting a tool will remove its configuration and associated execution records from our active databases.

*   **Data Portability:** You may request a copy of the data you have provided to us regarding your tools.

*   **Objection to Processing:** You may object to the processing of your information in certain circumstances.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us through the support channels provided within the Pi No-Code Tool Builder App or via the contact information provided in the Pi Network ecosystem.

## 7. Third-Party Services

Our App may integrate with or contain links to third-party services (e.g., the Pi Network authentication system). This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not manage. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you interact with.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

## 9. Contact Us
